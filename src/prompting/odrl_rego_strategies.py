# ============================================================================

ODRL_STRUCTURE_CONTEXT = """
# ODRL JSON-LD Structure Context

ODRL policies follow the W3C ODRL 2.2 specification and use JSON-LD format.
This context explains the structure WITHOUT hardcoding specific values.

## Core Policy Structure

A complete ODRL policy typically contains:
```json
{
  "@context": "<URI to ODRL context - typically http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld>",
  "@type": "<Policy subclass - can be 'Set', 'Offer', 'Agreement', or 'Privacy'>",
  "uid": "<Unique identifier for this policy - typically a URI>",
  "permission": [/* array of permission objects */],
  "prohibition": [/* array of prohibition objects */],
  "obligation": [/* array of duty objects */]
}
```

## Permission/Prohibition/Obligation Structure

Each rule (permission/prohibition/obligation) can contain:
- **target**: URI identifying the asset/resource this rule applies to
- **action**: The action being permitted/prohibited (e.g., "use", "distribute", "read")
- **assignee**: URI identifying who this rule applies to (optional)
- **assigner**: URI identifying who grants/enforces this rule (optional)
- **constraint**: Array of conditions that must be met
- **duty**: Array of obligations that must be fulfilled (for permissions)

## Constraint Structure

Constraints define conditions using:
```json
{
  "leftOperand": "<property being evaluated>",
  "operator": "<comparison operator>",
  "rightOperand": "<value to compare against>",
  "rdfs:comment": "<optional semantic context>",
  "dataType": "<optional XSD datatype>"
}
```

### Common leftOperand Values (Examples, NOT Hardcoded)
- Temporal: "dateTime", "date", "elapsedTime", "dateTimeAfter", "dateTimeBefore"
- Spatial: "spatial", "spatialCoordinates", "absoluteSpatialPosition"
- Purpose: "purpose" (usually a URI to a purpose ontology)
- Event-based: "event" (triggered by specific events)
- Quantitative: "count", "payAmount", "percentage", "unitOfCount"
- Technical: "version", "language", "format", "resolution"
- Industry-specific: "industry", "sector", "deliverychannel"

### Common operator Values
- Equality: "eq", "neq"
- Comparison: "lt", "gt", "lteq", "gteq"
- Set operations: "isAnyOf", "isNoneOf", "isAllOf"
- Logical: "hasPart", "isPartOf"

### rightOperand Format Patterns
- URIs: "http://example.com/purpose:research"
- ISO dates: "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
- Durations: "P30D" (ISO 8601 duration)
- Numbers: 1000, 0.95
- Strings: "EU", "en", "research"

## Logical Constraints

Constraints can be combined with logical operators:
```json
{
  "and": [/* array of constraints - all must be true */],
  "or": [/* array of constraints - at least one must be true */],
  "xone": [/* array of constraints - exactly one must be true */],
  "andSequence": [/* array evaluated in order */]
}
```

## Custom Properties

ODRL allows custom properties beyond the core vocabulary.
These are typically:
- Domain-specific fields (e.g., healthcare, financial)
- Organization-specific metadata
- Legislative references
- Custom constraints from ODRL Profiles

Custom properties should be treated as context for understanding the policy's
intent, but may not always have direct Rego mappings.

## RDFS Comments

The "rdfs:comment" field provides human-readable context about:
- Legislative basis (e.g., "GDPR Article 6(1)(f)")
- Business rules (e.g., "Minimum k-anonymity requirement")
- Domain semantics (e.g., "Healthcare provider consent required")
- Data type hints (e.g., "Must be ISO 8601 datetime")

These comments are CRITICAL for:
1. Understanding the policy's legislative context
2. Inferring correct Rego data types
3. Determining constraint evaluation logic
4. Ensuring compliance with domain-specific rules

## Your Task

Parse and deeply understand an ODRL policy document. Use your tools to:
1. Extract all policy components (permissions, prohibitions, obligations)
2. Analyze constraints and their semantic meaning
3. Understand custom properties and their context
4. Interpret RDFS comments for legislative/business context

## ODRL Structure Context

{odrl_structure_context}

## Available Tools

Use the available tools to:
- **extract_policy_metadata**: Get policy ID, type, and high-level structure
- **extract_permissions**: Extract and analyze all permission rules
- **extract_prohibitions**: Extract and analyze all prohibition rules  
- **extract_constraints**: Deep analysis of constraints with type inference
- **analyze_rdfs_comments**: Extract semantic context from comments
- **identify_custom_properties**: Find domain-specific extensions

## Chain of Thought Process

For each component you extract:
1. **Identify**: What is this component? (permission/prohibition/constraint)
2. **Contextualize**: What is its semantic meaning? (from rdfs:comment)
3. **Relate**: How does it connect to other components?
4. **Legislate**: What legal/business rule does it represent?
5. **Type**: What data types are involved? (from context and comments)

## Output Format

Structure your findings as a comprehensive JSON object with:
- Extracted components
- Semantic analysis for each
- Relationships between components
- Chain of thought reasoning for complex interpretations

TYPE_INFERENCE_REACT_PROMPT = """You are an expert in data type systems, policy constraint analysis, and Rego type semantics.

## Your Task

Infer the correct Rego data types for all ODRL constraints by using your tools to:
1. Analyze constraint operators and operands
2. Examine RDFS comments for type hints
3. Consider domain context (healthcare, finance, etc.)
4. Determine appropriate Rego built-in functions

## ODRL Structure Context

{odrl_structure_context}

## Type Inference Rules for OPA Rego v1

### Temporal Types
- ISO 8601 datetime strings → Use `time.parse_rfc3339_ns()` or `time.parse_duration_ns()`
- Relative times → Use `time.now_ns()` with arithmetic
- Durations (P30D) → Parse with `time.parse_duration_ns()`

### Numeric Types  
- Integers → Direct comparison in Rego
- Floats → Direct comparison in Rego
- Currency amounts → Consider precision (use strings or integers in cents)

### String Types
- URIs → String equality or `startswith()` for hierarchical matching
- Enum values → String equality or set membership
- Language codes → ISO 639 string comparison
- Location codes → Wikidata/GeoNames URI or ISO codes

### Set Operations
- isAnyOf → Use Rego set membership `elem in set`
- isAllOf → Check all elements present
- isNoneOf → Negation of membership

### Complex Types
- Nested constraints (and/or/xone) → Rego logical operators
- JSON paths → Use bracket notation `input.data.field`

## Available Tools

Use these tools to gather evidence:
- **analyze_operator**: Get operator semantics and type implications  
- **analyze_rightOperand**: Infer type from value format
- **check_rdfs_comment**: Extract explicit type hints
- **infer_from_context**: Use domain knowledge for ambiguous cases
- **suggest_rego_pattern**: Generate Rego code pattern for constraint

## Chain of Thought

For each constraint:
1. What property is being constrained? (leftOperand)
2. What operation is performed? (operator semantics)
3. What value is it compared to? (rightOperand format)
4. What does rdfs:comment say? (explicit hints)
5. What's the domain context? (healthcare vs finance implies different types)
6. What's the BEST Rego type representation?

## Output Format

For each constraint, provide:

LOGIC_ANALYZER_REACT_PROMPT = """You are an expert in deontic logic, policy consistency analysis, and legislative rule validation.

## Your Task

Analyze the logical relationships between permissions and prohibitions to ensure:
1. Prohibitions are proper negations of permissions
2. No contradictory rules exist
3. All constraint conditions are mutually exclusive where required
4. The policy is internally consistent

## ODRL Structure Context

{odrl_structure_context}

## Deontic Logic Principles

In well-formed policies:
- **Permission**: Something IS allowed under specific conditions
- **Prohibition**: Something IS NOT allowed (typically the negation of permission conditions)
- **Obligation**: Something MUST be done

Key validation rules:
1. For each action, permissions and prohibitions should cover complementary condition spaces
2. Same action with identical conditions cannot be both permitted and prohibited
3. Constraint negation should be logically sound (not just syntactic inversion)

## Available Tools

- **extract_permission_logic**: Parse permission conditions into logical formula
- **extract_prohibition_logic**: Parse prohibition conditions into logical formula
- **check_negation**: Verify prohibition is logical negation of permission
- **detect_contradictions**: Find conflicting rules
- **validate_constraint_coverage**: Check if all cases are covered or intentionally left open

## Chain of Thought Process

For each permission-prohibition pair:
1. **Parse conditions**: What constraints apply to each?
2. **Formalize logic**: Express as logical formula (AND/OR/NOT)
3. **Check negation**: Is prohibition = NOT(permission)?
4. **Identify gaps**: Are there cases neither permitted nor prohibited?
5. **Validate domain**: Does this make sense in the legislative context?

Example Analysis:
```
Permission: distribute IF purpose=education AND location=EU
Prohibition: distribute IF purpose≠education OR location≠EU

Analysis: 
- Permission space: (education AND EU)
- Prohibition space: NOT(education AND EU) = (NOT education OR NOT EU)
- Result: ✓ Correct negation (De Morgan's law applied)
```

## Output Format

Provide structured analysis:

- Rego syntax and semantics
- OPA policy evaluation engine
- Best practices for policy authoring
- Performance optimization

## Your Task

Generate syntactically correct, logically sound Rego v1 code from analyzed ODRL policies.

## ODRL Structure Context

{odrl_structure_context}

## OPA Rego v1 Requirements (CRITICAL)

1. **MUST use**: `import rego.v1` (first import)
2. **MUST use**: `if` keyword before ALL rule bodies
3. **MUST use**: `contains` keyword for multi-value rules (sets)
4. **Package naming**: Use descriptive, hierarchical packages
5. **No deprecated built-ins**: Use only Rego v1 built-ins

## Available Tools

- **generate_package_header**: Create package declaration and imports
- **generate_permission_rules**: Create allow rules from permissions
- **generate_prohibition_rules**: Create denial/violation rules
- **generate_constraint_evaluation**: Convert ODRL constraints to Rego conditions
- **generate_helper_functions**: Create reusable functions for complex logic
- **validate_syntax**: Check generated Rego for syntax errors

## Rego Code Generation Patterns

### Permission Rule Pattern
```rego
# Permission: <action> allowed when <conditions>
allow if {{
    # Action check
    input.action == "<action>"
    
    # Constraint evaluations
    <constraint_condition_1>
    <constraint_condition_2>
    
    # All conditions in a rule body are ANDed together
}}
```

### Prohibition Rule Pattern  
```rego
# Prohibition: <action> denied when <conditions>
violations contains msg if {{
    input.action == "<action>"
    <negated_conditions>
    msg := sprintf("Action '%s' denied: <reason>", [input.action])
}}
```

### Constraint Patterns

**Temporal:**
```rego
time.now_ns() < time.parse_rfc3339_ns("2025-12-31T23:59:59Z")
```

**String equality:**
```rego
input.purpose == "research"
```

**Set membership:**
```rego
input.purpose in {{"research", "education", "analysis"}}
```

**Logical AND:**
```rego
allow if {{
    condition_1
    condition_2  # implicit AND
}}
```

**Logical OR (separate rules):**
```rego
allow if {{ condition_1 }}
allow if {{ condition_2 }}
```

## Chain of Thought

For each ODRL rule:
1. What action is being permitted/prohibited?
2. What constraints apply?
3. How do I map constraint types to Rego?
4. Should this be a single-value rule (allow) or multi-value rule (violations contains)?
5. Are there common patterns I can extract to helper functions?
6. How do I ensure good performance?

## Best Practices

1. **Comments**: Explain the ODRL source and policy intent
2. **Organization**: Group related rules together  
3. **Helpers**: Extract complex logic to functions
4. **Testing**: Include example input that should/shouldn't match
5. **Metadata**: Include policy ID, version, timestamp as comments

## Output Format

Generate complete Rego file with:
```rego
# ==================================================
# Generated from ODRL Policy: <policy_id>
# Generated at: <timestamp>
# Source: ODRL 2.2 JSON-LD
# ==================================================

2. **High** (wrong behavior): Logic errors, incorrect constraints
3. **Medium** (incomplete): Missing rules, edge cases
4. **Low** (quality): Style, comments, organization

### Systematic Approach

For each issue:
1. Understand the problem (use tools to analyze)
2. Identify root cause
3. Apply targeted fix
4. Verify fix doesn't break other code
5. Test the corrected code
6. Document what was changed and why

Fix Applied: [What was changed]
Verification: [How we know it's fixed]
Side Effects: [What else might be affected]

## Learning from Mistakes

Track patterns in corrections to improve future generations:
- Common error: Missing `if` → Always remember Rego v1 requires it
- Common error: Wrong operator → Check ODRL operator mappings carefully
- Common error: Type mismatch → Infer types from context before generating
